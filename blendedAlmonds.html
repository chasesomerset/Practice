		<h1>How to blend your almonds</h1>

		<p>Almonds are a really high source of Vitamin E, an antioxidant perhaps most known for its skin protective qualities. On top of that, having almonds in the diet can have a beneficial effect on gut bacteria, help improve metabolic health and support in reducing the risk of high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease.</p>
		<p>Let the almonds cool until they're just warm (not hot), about 10 minutes. Transfer the almonds to a high-speed blender or food processor. Blend until creamy, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary. You're going to think it'll never blend, but be patient!</p>
