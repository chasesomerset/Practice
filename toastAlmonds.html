		<h1>How to toast your almonds</h1>

		<p>Toasting almonds is an easy way to bring out their natural flavor while adding a little extra crunch in the process.</p>
		<p>Stovetop method: Place the nuts in a dry skillet (no oil) over medium heat. Heat, shaking the pan and stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the nuts are fragrant and golden brown (if sliced or slivered), about 4 to 5 minutes. Stay at the stove because the nuts can easily burn! Remove immediately from the heat and transfer to a plate to stop the cooking.</p>
		<p>Oven method: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the nuts on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for about 7 to 8 minutes until fragrant and golden brown (if sliced or slivered), stirring once. Do not stray far from the oven, since the nuts can go from toasted to burned quickly. Remove immediately and transfer to a plate to stop the cooking.</p>
